<h1 class="title toc-ignore">How to build a game</h1>

</div>


<p>This document is intended to help you build a game using the <a
href="https://github.com/EcoKnowGames/creator">EcoKnowGames creator</a>
tool. The creator uses the <a href="https://unity.com/download">Unity
Game Engine</a> to build games that integrate scientific models and
collect data on in-game environments and game player decisions. Building
these games does not require a high level of technical skill. There is
no coding involved, and while it is useful to understand the scientific
models underlying game mechanics, these models are well-established and
numerical details can be sourced from the scientific literature or
pre-set examples. All of the required software is free. The real barrier
to getting started is knowing (1) what to download and install, (2) how
to use the EcoKnowGames creator in Unity, (3) how to deploy a game, and
(4) how to collect in-game data. This document will get you started and
help you establish a work flow for building ecological knowledge games.
Once you are comfortable with this work flow, you should be able to
create and deploy any number of turn-based games with unique interacting
entities, game rules, and landscapes.</p>
<p>If you get stuck while working through this how-to, please let us
know in the <a
href="https://github.com/orgs/EcoKnowGames/discussions">EcoKnowGame
Discussion</a> or contact the <a
href="https://ecoknowgames.github.io/contact.html">Project Leader</a>.
The <a href="https://ecoknowgames.github.io/index.html">EcoKnowGames
project</a> is a highly interdisciplinary research programme, and a key
objective of it is to make knowledge game development accessible for
researchers with as few technical hurdles as possible.</p>
<hr />
<div id="downloading-and-installing" class="section level1">
<h1>1. Downloading and installing</h1>
<p>To build a game, you need to install git version control software,
the <a href="https://unity.com/download">Unity Game Engine</a>, and the
<a href="https://github.com/EcoKnowGames/creator">EcoKnowGames
creator</a> tool that works within Unity. Both Unity and the
EcoKnowGames creator are free and work across Windows, MacOS, and Linux.
We recommend downloading Unity first.</p>
<div id="downloading-unity" class="section level2">
<h2>Downloading Unity</h2>
<p>You can download the Unity Hub here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://unity.com/download"
class="uri">https://unity.com/download</a> (do not install the game
engine yet)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that you will need to download the Unity Hub and the Unity game
engine. The Unity Hub is an application for accessing the Unity
environment, and the game engine is used within it to build games. Unity
is regularly updating its game engine. The version that you need is
6000.0, which you can find here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/6000.0.65f1"
class="uri">https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/6000.0.65f1</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The download takes a considerable amount of hard drive space. Even if
you are only planning to use Unity for EcoKnowGames projects, you will
probably need about 15 GB of space on your hard drive.</p>
</div>
<div id="downloading-git" class="section level2">
<h2>Downloading git</h2>
<p>Next, we recommend downloading git (<a href="https://git-scm.com/"
class="uri">https://git-scm.com/</a>). Git is version control software;
it tracks changes to files over time and allows you to view the entire
history of a folder and keep multiple versions of it. You do not need to
know how git works to build a game with EcoKnowGames, but it does need
to be installed on your computer. Git is free and open source, and it
works for Windows, macOS, and Linux. You can download it here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://git-scm.com/install"
class="uri">https://git-scm.com/install</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Git is a very useful tool for managing large projects (and not just
code). The EcoKnowGames creator (and other tools in the EcoKnowGames
project) use git, with files hosted on <a
href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> (<a
href="https://github.com/EcoKnowGames/creator"
class="uri">https://github.com/EcoKnowGames/creator</a>).</p>
</div>
<div id="downloading-ecoknowgames-creator" class="section level2">
<h2>Downloading EcoKnowGames creator</h2>
<p>The EcoKnowGames creator works within Unity. You can download the
creator here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/EcoKnowGames/creator/"
class="uri">https://github.com/EcoKnowGames/creator/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are familiar with GitHub, then the best approach here would be
to fork or clone the repository. But you can also click the green button
to open a pulldown menu, then choose ‘Download ZIP’. Extract the
downloaded ZIP file and place the folder somewhere that you will be able
to find it again.</p>
<p>Once you have downloaded Unity, git, and the EcoKnowGames creator,
you are ready to get started in Unity.</p>
<hr />
</div>
</div>
<div id="how-to-use-the-ecoknowgames-creator" class="section level1">
<h1>2. How to use the EcoKnowGames creator</h1>
<p>To get started, you need to open Unity. When you first open unity,
you will be asked to create an account. Once you create an account, you
can sign into Unity Hub. After agreeing to the Unity licence, Unity
might recommend that you install the latest version of Unity; <strong>do
not update</strong>. The EcoKnowGames creator only works with 6000.0, so
you do not want to update to a more recent version. Skip the
installation if you are prompted. You should see a panel on the left
with options that include ‘Projects’ and ‘Installs’. Click on ‘Installs’
first, then check to make sure that you have Unity 6000.0 LTS installed.
Now is a good time to also add some build support options. Click the
‘Manage’ pulldown on the right and choose ‘Add modules’. If not
installed already, then install ‘Web Build Support’.</p>
<p>Next, navigate to ‘Projects’ from the options to the left. This is
how we get to the EcoKnowGames creator. In the upper right, click the
‘Add’ pullown menu and choose ‘Add project from disk’. Find the
EcoKnowGames folder that you downloaded, then click it and choose
‘Open’. The new project should appear in your Projects list.</p>
<hr />
<div class="float">

alt="Figure 1: Screenshot of Unity Hub with EcoKnowGames creator tool listed under available projects." />
<div class="figcaption">Figure 1: Screenshot of Unity Hub with
EcoKnowGames creator tool listed under available projects.</div>
</div>
<hr />
<p>To get started, click on the ‘creator’ project (it might take some
time to open). When the creator opens, you will see a large developer
environment with a lot of different panels. The game display is the most
prominent in the centre, but you should also see folders on the bottom,
all of which are in a folder called ’_EcoKnow’, which is within
‘Assets’.</p>
<hr />
<div class="float">
<img src="img/EcoKnowGames_assets.png"
alt="Figure 2: Project tab in Unity with several subfolders inside a folder called ’_EcoKnow’, which is inside a folder called ‘Assets’." />
<div class="figcaption">Figure 2: Project tab in Unity with several
subfolders inside a folder called ’_EcoKnow’, which is inside a folder
called ‘Assets’.</div>
</div>
<hr />
<p>In the _EcoKnow folder, there are subfolders: Fonts, Maps, Matrices,
Resources, Sandbox, Scenario Editor, and UI. You can safely ignore
Fonts, Sandbox, and UI. The rest will be important for the workflow of
game design:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maps</strong> are where all of the game maps are stored as
plain text CSV files.</li>
<li><strong>Matrices</strong> define how different in-game entities
(e.g., environmental resources or biological populations) interact with
each other (more on this below), as stored in a plain text CSV
file.</li>
<li><strong>Resources</strong> stores game art (in the ‘Icons’ folder)
and the final game files (in the ‘Scenarios’ folder).</li>
<li><strong>Scenario Editor</strong> is where game mechanics are stored
(e.g., win conditions, items, and generally how everything comes
together to make a game).</li>
</ul>
<p>We will go through the contents of each of these subfolders in the
order in which they become relevant during game-making. The starting
place is the creation of a game matrix.</p>
<div id="game-matrices" class="section level2">
<h2>Game matrices</h2>
<p>Every EcoKnowGames game is played on a map composed of discrete
square tiles and discrete time steps (i.e., rounds). A game matrix tells
us how one entity on a tile will affect the count of another entity on
the same tile in the next time step. A concrete example will illustrate
the idea. Consider a game where there are three entities: Hare, Fox, and
Rock. Foxes eat hares, so all else being equal, adding a fox to a
landscape tile will tend to decrease the number of hares on it. Foxes
benefit from this interaction, so all else being equal, adding hares to
a landscape tile will tend to increase the number of foxes on it. We
will assume that rocks do not interact at all with hares or foxes. The
game matrix for this system is shown in Table 1.</p>
<table>
<caption>EcoKnowGames matrix for setting up a game with a predator-prey
relationship between hares and foxes, and rocks that are purely
decorative.</caption>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Hare</th>
<th>Fox</th>
<th>Rock</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>-0.01</td>
<td>-0.01</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>0.04</td>
<td>-0.01</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Each number in the table above tells us how the entity in a given
column affects the entity in a row. For example, a hare (column 1)
affects foxes (row 2) by increasing their numbers by a value of 0.04.
All else being equal, if there are 100 hares on a landscape tile, then
the number of foxes in the next time step will increase by 4. Similarly,
the -0.01 in column 1 and row 2 indicates that if there are 100 foxes on
a landscape tile, then the number of hares in the next time step will
decrease by 1. Note that there is also a -0.01 in column 1 and row 1,
and in column 2 and row 2. This models self-regulation, so if the number
of hares or foxes on a landscape tile is high, then that number will
tend to decrease in the next time step (e.g., due to overcrowding or
competition for resources). In contrast, the zeros in row and column 3
indicates that rocks are not affected by anything in the system,
including themselves.</p>
<p>The actual details are a bit more complicated because the change in
entity number will also be affected by its intrinsic growth rate. More
technically, games use generalised Lotka-Volterra equations to model
entity dynamics, and game matrices are the interaction matrices used in
these equations. We do not need to worry about these details yet (and
there are other possibilities for entity dynamics). What matters for
getting started is having a matrix with the format above (<a
href="https://github.com/EcoKnowGames/creator/blob/main/Assets/_EcoKnow/Matrices/Hare%2C%20Fox%2C%20Rocks%20-%20Unstable.csv">see
here</a> for the CSV file) and having some intuitive sense of how it
works. The reason for making the underlying model so abstract is that
this framework can be applied to a very wide range of complex system
dynamics (i.e., not just predator-prey interactions, or even just
biological interactions). To get started quickly, we can use the <a
href="https://ecoknowgames.github.io/find_matrix/">find_matrix</a>
application online to produce a stable random system:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://ecoknowgames.github.io/find_matrix/"
class="uri">https://ecoknowgames.github.io/find_matrix/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any set of entities generated with this application will be stable,
in the sense that no entities will be driven extinct or exhibit endless
growth. To use the application, set the number of entities that you want
and click ‘Find Matrix’, then download the CSV and record the r and N
values. You can rename the columns after downloading. To see how these
entities change over time in the absence of any player intervention, you
can use the <a
href="https://ecoknowgames.github.io/simulate/">simulation
application</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://ecoknowgames.github.io/simulate/"
class="uri">https://ecoknowgames.github.io/simulate/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Upload the CSV file to the application, then input the intrinsic
growth rates (r values) and abundances (N values) in the panel on the
left. You can leave the number of rounds, landscape dimension, and
movement parameters as they are. When you click ‘run simulation’, the
plot on the right should show all entities persisting at some finite
abundance over time. For now, this is all that is needed to set up a
game, so we can move on to setting up a game map.</p>
</div>
<div id="game-maps" class="section level2">
<h2>Game maps</h2>
<p>Creating a map is more user friendly than creating the interaction
matrix. Making a map can be done with the <a
href="https://ecoknowgames.github.io/map/">EcoKnow Map Editor</a>
online:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://ecoknowgames.github.io/map/"
class="uri">https://ecoknowgames.github.io/map/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To use the map editor, upload the interaction matrix CSV file from
the previous section. Click ‘Reset View’ in the panel on the left to
centre the map, and use W and H to change the size of the landscape.
Scroll down in the left panel and choose ‘Terrain’ to add green terrain
tiles. Terrain tiles will be playable in the game, while black tiles
will be unplayable and empty (i.e., no entities can exist on them).</p>
<p>After adding terrain tiles to achieve the desired shape of the
landscape, you can add any number of entities to each tile. Click the
entities in the left panel, then increase or decrease the number under
‘Drawing Tools’ to choose the amount of each entity to put on a tile. To
place the entities on a tile, simply click the tile. You can thereby
distribute entities over the landscape however you choose, and this will
be the distribution of entities at the start of a game. When you are
finished, click ‘Downlaod Map.csv’ under ‘Export’ in the left panel. You
are now ready to start building the actual game in Unity.</p>
</div>
<div id="scenario-editor" class="section level2">
<h2>Scenario Editor</h2>
<p>Recall the folders in the project tab from Figure 2. Before doing
anything else, put your newly created matrix in the ‘Matrices’ folder,
and put your newly created map in the ‘Maps’ folder. This will ensure
that both are available in the Scenario Editor. You might need to reopen
the EcoKnowGames creator project from the start of Step 2 if you have
closed out of it (see above).</p>
<p>From inside the creator, go to the bottom panel and find the
‘Scenario Editor’ folder on the left. You might see some existing
scenarios in the bottom middle. Right click somewhere here to bring up a
pull-down menu (Figure 3).</p>
<hr />
<div class="float">
<img src="img/Scenario_Editor.png"
alt="Figure 3: Bottom panel of the EcoKnowGames Scenario Editor in Unity showing several scenarios. A pull-down window is shown where the cursor has been right-clicked in the centre." />
<div class="figcaption">Figure 3: Bottom panel of the EcoKnowGames
Scenario Editor in Unity showing several scenarios. A pull-down window
is shown where the cursor has been right-clicked in the centre.</div>
</div>
<hr />
<p>From the pull-down menu, navigate to ‘Create’, then ‘Scenario Node
Graph’. This will bring up a new xNode to start building a game. The
xNode interface allows you to organise the game options. Right click and
hold to move around in xNode, and scroll to zoom in and out. We
recommend maximising xNode to give yourself as much space as possible,
then placing game options in the following order:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Scenario:</strong> The first thing to do in xNode is
right click somewhere in the middle and select ‘Scenario’. A scenario
box will pop up, which will allow you to specify the scenario name,
author, total game rounds, actions that a player can take per round, and
the amount currency a player has a the beginning of a game. You can also
set a random seed value for the game, but this is not
necessary.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Matrix</strong>: Right click to the left of the Scenario
box and choose ‘Matrix’. A box titled ‘Matrix’ will appear. In this box,
to the right of ‘Matrices CSV’, you will see ‘None’, then a small circle
on the far right. Click on this small circle to open a list of available
CSV matrix files. Find the one that you made and select it; entities
will automatically be filled in below. Lastly, click and hold on the red
circle on the right of the Matrix box, then drag a line to the red dot
called ‘Matrix’ in the Scenario box. The entities will then appear in
circles on the right side of the Scenario box.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Map</strong>: Right click again to the left of the
Scenario box and choose ‘Map’. A box titled ‘Map’ will appear. Click and
hold the yellow circle on the right side of the Map box, then drag a
line to the yellow dot called ‘Map’ in the Scenario box.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Entities</strong>: On the right side of the scenario box,
right click and choose ‘Entity’. On the Scenario box, click and hold the
‘Hare’ circle, then drag a line to the circle on the left side of the
new Entity box. On the right side of the new Entity box, there will be a
right arrow followed by a set of ellipses (…). Click on the arrow to see
the options for this entity. You should be able to edit the information
here, including the icon, colour, growth rate, movement rate (i.e.,
probability of moving to an adjacent tile), densities of vulnerability
and abundance, and the ability to harvest or introduce. But note that if
this is not working for any reason, you can also close out xNode and
edit this information directly in the Scenario Editor on Unity (see
Figure 4). You can do this for any box that you place in xNode (note
that when you attempt to select an icon, options appear from the
Resources &gt; Icons folder; you can place custom icons here to appear
in the game). Repeat this process for all of the entities so that every
entity is connected to the Scenario box.</p></li>

called ‘hare meat’ with a value of 2 currency. To create an item, right
click to the left of the Scenario box and choose ‘item’. Drag the grey
circle on the right side of the newly created Item box to the ‘Items’
circle on the left side of the Scenario box. You will need to name the
item and ideally give it an icon. You can connect as many items as you
want to the Scenario box.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Item Quantity:</strong> To make sure that you get items
from harvesting an entity, right click somewhere and choose ‘Item
Quantity’. Choose the item that you want from the pull-down in the Item
Quantity box (e.g., ‘Hare meat’), then connect the blue ‘Quantity’
circle on the right to the ‘Harvest Quantity’ circle of an entity (see
Figure 5).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Currency Quantity:</strong> To specify an amount of
currency needed to introduce one entity to a tile, right click somewhere
and choose ‘Currency Quantity’. Specify a quantity in the box, then link
the blue ‘Quantity’ circle to the blue ‘Introduce Quantity’ of an
entity. Note that you can also link Item Quantity boxes to this
‘Introduce Quantity’ circle if you want introducing an entity to cost a
specific number of items (or any combination of items and
currency).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Win Conditions:</strong> Lastly, you need to specify what
the win conditions are for the game. Win conditions are defined by
keeping the total number of one or more entities within a specific range
for a given number of rounds. For example, we might want to keep the
total hare population between 100 and 2000 for 4 rounds (Figure
5).</p></li>

<p>Once you have your game set up, you need to export it as a JSON file
and place it in the Resources &gt; Scenarios folder. There are two ways
to do this. First, from within xNode, you can right click and choose the
‘Export JSON’ option. Second, you can go back to the Scenario Editor
(i.e., bottom middle panel in Figure 4), then click on the Scenario icon
(‘New Scena…’ in Figure 4). In the upper right of the right panel, you
will see vertical elipses (Figure 6, upper right). Click these and
select ‘Export JSON’ from the pull-down menu. A pop up box will appear
letting you know where the JSON file has been saved (it might not be
where you expect, so look at the file path carefully).</p>
