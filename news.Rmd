The EcoKnowGames project enters its third month. In January, we held a kick-off meeting at the University of Stirling, and in February we welcomed postdoctoral researchers Ted Cimpeanu and Marly Samuel to the university and the research team. A [GitHub organisation](https://github.com/ecoknowgames) has been set up, which will hold code for project outputs.
