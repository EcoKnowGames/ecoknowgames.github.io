How humans collectively respond to environmental change will ultimately determine the degree to which many global challenges of the 21st century are successfully met. Global challenges are reflected across multiple United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including conserving biodiversity, ensuring food and water security, and responding to climate change. Finding effective SDG solutions is critical but often hindered by the undesirable risk, high cost, and long timescale of their implementation. The EcoKnowGames project develops virtual game worlds to address challenges for sustainable development.
